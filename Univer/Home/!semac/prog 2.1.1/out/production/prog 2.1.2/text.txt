    Some collection implementations have restrictions on the elements that they may contain. For example, some
implementations prohibit null elements, and some have restrictions on the types of their elements. Attempting to add
an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically NullPointerException or ClassCastException. Attempting
to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception, or it may simply return false; some
implementations will exhibit the former behavior and some will exhibit the letter. More generally, attempting  an
operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in the insertion of an ineligible element into the
collection may throw an exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation. Such exceptions are marked
as optional in the specification for this interface. I need a fish that truly represents my essence. Class Object is the
root of the class hierarchy. Every class has Object as a superclass. All objects, including arrays, implement the methods
of this class. The group  is running on the beach.
